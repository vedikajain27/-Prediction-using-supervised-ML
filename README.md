# -Prediction-using-supervised-ML
Welcome to the Prediction using supervised ML Project!!! In this project, I'm going to predict the mark of student based of the number of hours studied. It is a simplest linear regression model as it involves 2 variables they are hours of study and score of students.

Linear Regression Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.

Step to be followed: while doing this project i have followed some steps of ML.

Importing and Reading dataset. Visualization and Analyzation of Dataset. Preparation of dataset Training of Machine Learning Model (Algorithm) Visualize the Model Making Predictions Evaluating the model Dataset URL: http://bit.ly/w-data The above dataset contains 'Hours' studied and 'Scores' of students which we are going to use for prediction.

Let's go started !!!
